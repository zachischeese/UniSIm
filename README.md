# Welcome to UniSim!

This is a universe expansion simulator for use in the classroom.

Use the links above to download it.

# Download UniSim
To download UniSim, click [here](https://github.com/zachischeese/UniSIm/releases/download/1/UniSim.zip).
To get the source, please wait. I'm going to up load it at home (I'm literally typing this in a café).

## UniSim Users Guide

Thank you for downloading UniSim! UniSim is a basic simulation off the expansion of the universe for use in classrooms.

### Launching UniSim

Launch UniSim by double clicking the icon. You will be presented with a resolution and quality settings dialog.

Use this dialog to select your preferred resolution (higher requires a more powerful computer) and graphics quality settings (higher requires a more powerful computer). The defaults should be fine, however change them if you need to. Check the “Windowed” box to run the simulator in a window, or leave unchecked to run fullscreen.

When you are ready to launch the simulation, click Play.

UniSim is also available on the web. It will automatically launch without any user interaction when the page is visited.

### Interacting with the Simulation

This is the simulation interface. The camera is attached to one of the galaxies spawned. The view in the bottom left is similar to the balloon model, where the observer sits outside of the universe and looks inwards. The galaxy that the main camera is attached to is highlighted in red in this smaller view.

Use the slider to adjust the number of spawned galaxies. Most systems should be able to handle up to 100 galaxies. More powerful systems can run over this limit.

The simulation can run up to 200 galaxies. This number upper limit is set as most computers find more galaxies difficult to handle. The galaxy count will turn red over 120 galaxies as anything higher may reduce the frame rate (smoothness) of the simulation.

Click the “Reset Simulation” button to reset the simulation and apply the new values.

You can look around the simulation with the main camera by moving the mouse around.

If you are using the simulation in full screen mode, use the “Quit” button to exit the simulation. When in windowed mode, this or the title bar controls can be used to quit.

UniSim web works identically to the desktop version. To take UniSim web full screen, click the blue full screen icon in the bottom right. To exit full screen, hit escape.

Note: UniSim web will perform worse than UniSim desktop. This is a technical limitation of WebGL.

### Troubleshooting

This simulation is built on the Unity3D game engine. As a result, some school anti-virus or software restriction programs may pick it up as a game, and the simulation may not launch. Speak to your IT technicians or service providers and ask for an exception to be added for UniSim. You may still be able to access UniSim Web even if the main desktop version is blocked.

If you get an error asking for UniSim to be placed with a folder named “UniSim_Data”, ensure that there is a folder called “UniSim Data” where the main program is installed. If the software was downloaded as a Zip file, try unzipping it again. If it was downloaded as an EXE, try re-installing.

If the simulation is not smooth, jitters or is slow, you may not have a powerful enough computer to run it smoothly. Try reducing the graphics quality settings and the resolution. If the resolution and quality configuration window does not open on startup, try holding the ALT (Windows) or OPTION (MacOS) key down. The configuration window should now show up.

### Contact

If you want to contact me for any reason regarding the simulator, I am on Twitter. My handle is @ElaTheDeveloper. If you find the software useful, please consider donating. My donations page is at [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/elathedeveloper). Every penny enables me to continue creating software like this.

I hope you enjoy using UniSim and hope it helps you in your classroom!
